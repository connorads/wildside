# Playtest Backlog

Canonical tracker for bugs, missing features, and verification gaps. See `CLAUDE.md`
for iteration protocol, `docs/source-port/methodology.md` for the investigation
playbook, and `docs/source-port/roadmap.md` for the programme-level workstreams.

Important: a green TAS frontier or a green `1p-accurate` release artefact does **not**
mean the game is nearly finished. Native-play breakage, wider verification gaps, and
documented deviations belong here too.

Progress language uses the evidence ladder from `methodology.md`:
`stubbed`, `boots`, `replay-matched`, `branch-matched`, `mechanic-swept`, `human-play-stable`.
A closed TAS frontier proves `replay-matched` on that route, not `human-play-stable`.

Status: `[ ]` open, `[~]` in progress, `[f]` frozen lane (standing decision; never selectable, do not extend), `[?]` proposed fix awaiting objective evidence or human validation, `[x]` done, `[-]` won't fix / not a bug, `[b]` blocked / needs human repro
Priority: P0 (game-breaking), P1 (core feel), P2 (missing system), P3 (polish)

`[?]` items carry an evidence block recording the investigation outcome: repro
scenario path, ASM labels cited, oracle-parity result, and the proposed-fix
commit hash. Agents may close objective bugs under
[`completion-campaign.md`](completion-campaign.md); subjective/device checks stay
for the final human playtest. If investigation stalls, record the rejected
hypotheses and next experiment under `#NNN` in the archive, park the case and
continue other useful work. Never commit repeated investigation churn.

Awaiting-human rows live in `backlog-awaiting-human.md` and add `Target` (`0xNN`,
`boot`, `demo`, `demo:0xNN`, `audio-device`, `recording:<slug>`, or `unknown`) plus
a short human-facing `Check` sentence so tools can show exactly what a playtester
must validate. The `Check` names the symptom and action directly; vague fallbacks like
"retest the reported route" belong in neither docs nor `project-status`.

## NOW

- **Current work (2026-09-27):** #370 remains in progress after the first natural Dragon-breath death/reload timing unit. The saved 620-frame JEV route now reaches live Level 0 on oracle frame 571 instead of nine frames early; title-card object/RNG cadence is exact through the Start hand-off. The verified cleanup negative control fails after a 303-frame common prefix.
- **Selection:** Continue #370 from the first remaining authoritative Load_InGame state boundary. Oracle clears Kid at frame 529, clears the title roster at 533, and begins camera preload at 559. Reuse the saved route and offline check; do not navigate again.
- **Scope:** Single-player across all playable levels, branches, forms and bosses. Preserve frozen #406/#409/#416 timing debt and its ratchets. Final package retains subjective/device checks; no human validation is claimed.
- **Jev allowance:** $5 additional across the campaign. BLW2 used 100 requests and $0.010448214. #502 used 269 charged requests across its three allowed attempts, adding $0.045005898. #433 used 84 requests across two attempts. The ledger lifetime charged upper bound is $0.250016004, including $0.000242592 for the #344 smoke. #370 checks used saved input only and spent nothing. #502's window and attempts are exhausted.
- **Jev exploration review:** Revision `cf5d84937`. #433 was the highest-priority eligible gap, but its 20-minute case window had expired. Offline ROM graph discovery replaced the false no-entry premise and found the natural Crypt chain. No request or spend occurred. Restart the three-fix cadence from this review.
- **#370 evidence:** `.cache/jev-cases/1790466052336068000` records fatal frame 302, title reload frame 409 and live frame 571. Replay trace matches. Oracle state remains red at the later Load_InGame WRAM phases, so navigation success does not close the issue.
- **Evidence boundary:** Published-route state/RNG gates cover one route. Frozen visual debt is 241 frames / 2,391 pixels. Neither that replay nor idle sweep checkpoints proves whole-game completion.

NOW is the current-state handoff: rewrite it at the end of every loop session, never
append. Old handoffs go to [`session-log.md`](./session-log.md).

For newly opened items, capture these facts in the investigation notes:

- evidence source: playtest, recording slug, oracle, or frame capture
- native repro status: reproduced / not yet reproduced
- oracle repro status: authoritative / advisory / unknown / oracle limitation
- minimum gate: `fast-slice`, `1p-playable`, `1p-accurate`, or `visual-parity`

| # | Status | Pri | System | Summary | Verify |
|-----|--------|-----|--------|---------|--------|
| 370 | [~] | P0 | enemy/projectile | Natural Dragon-breath death clears the projectile and resumes on the oracle frame; hidden Load_InGame WRAM phases still differ. | Saved 620-frame JEV route reaches live frame 571 with verified cleanup control; continue from Kid clear frame 529, roster clear 533 and camera preload 559. See archive #370. |
| 406 | [f] | P1 | rendering | FROZEN with #409 per ADR 0002: the lane stops accruing sessions; the march stays metered as ADR 0001 left it (frontier 995, injection ratchet). Residue authority moves to census-scoped reconstruction + raster-span-replay. | Do not extend the march; ratchets stay green; take #442-#450 instead. See ADR 0002. |
| 409 | [f] | P1 | rendering | FROZEN per ADR 0002: the recurrence is a downward-only witness (scheduled-frames ratchet 736 / boundary 1657; tas-pixel-baseline). ADR 0003 corrected the spans; #459 found the bounded entry phase non-invertible and closed NO-GO. | Do not extend or promote the lane; keep the 2,391-pixel and scheduled-frame ratchets green. Evidence: archive #459. |
| 416 | [f] | P2 | audio | Frontier FROZEN at frames 0..922 (decision in archive #416): `gems_frame_signature_v1` is a regression witness only; command parity (#435) supersedes it as audio authority. | Never advance `modelled_frames`; #434-#438 closed, remaining audio debt tracked via #439-#441; keep verify-tas-full green. |
