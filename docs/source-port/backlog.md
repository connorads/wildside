# Playtest Backlog

Canonical tracker for bugs, missing features, and verification gaps. See `CLAUDE.md`
for iteration protocol, `docs/source-port/methodology.md` for the investigation
playbook, and `docs/source-port/roadmap.md` for the programme-level workstreams.

Important: a green TAS frontier or a green `1p-accurate` release artefact does **not**
mean the game is nearly finished. Native-play breakage, wider verification gaps, and
documented deviations belong here too.

Progress language uses the evidence ladder from `methodology.md`:
`stubbed`, `boots`, `replay-matched`, `branch-matched`, `mechanic-swept`, `human-play-stable`.
A closed TAS frontier proves `replay-matched` on that route, not `human-play-stable`.

Status: `[ ]` open, `[~]` in progress, `[f]` frozen lane (standing decision; never selectable, do not extend), `[?]` proposed fix awaiting objective evidence or human validation, `[x]` done, `[-]` won't fix / not a bug, `[b]` blocked / needs human repro
Priority: P0 (game-breaking), P1 (core feel), P2 (missing system), P3 (polish)

`[?]` items carry an evidence block recording the investigation outcome: repro
scenario path, ASM labels cited, oracle-parity result, and the proposed-fix
commit hash. Agents may close objective bugs under
[`completion-campaign.md`](completion-campaign.md); subjective/device checks stay
for the final human playtest. If investigation stalls, record the rejected
hypotheses and next experiment under `#NNN` in the archive, park the case and
continue other useful work. Never commit repeated investigation churn.

Awaiting-human rows live in `backlog-awaiting-human.md` and add `Target` (`0xNN`,
`boot`, `demo`, `demo:0xNN`, `audio-device`, `recording:<slug>`, or `unknown`) plus
a short human-facing `Check` sentence so tools can show exactly what a playtester
must validate. The `Check` names the symptom and action directly; vague fallbacks like
"retest the reported route" belong in neither docs nor `project-status`.

## NOW

- **Current work (2026-09-21):** #508's Driller Gfx velocity projection is fixed and verified on 360 replay checkpoints. #502 needs a moving high-pressure Drips encounter; idle probes on candidate levels stay below 20 Objects. #300 teleporter traversal and #433 Robot hurt/turn interruptions and natural entry remain open, along with parent roster gaps, slope poses and rubber art.
- **Selection:** Run `mise run project-status` and `mise run jev-audit`. Objective awaiting-human cases are eligible for investigation and evidence-backed closure. Coverage prerequisites come first, then P0 #210, #370 and #374 according to dependencies and available evidence.
- **Scope:** Single-player across all playable levels, branches, forms and bosses. Preserve frozen #406/#409/#416 timing debt and its ratchets. Final package retains subjective/device checks; no human validation is claimed.
- **Jev allowance:** $5 additional across the campaign. First attempt used 100 requests and $0.010448214; lifetime charged upper bound is $0.186974676. The six-frame preflight passed, but collection stalled at x58 and did not reach the pad. Its deadline was expired under the ledger lock, preserving spend, attempt count and the original case window. Actor coordinate units are corrected; add a progress/stall guard before any further paid attempt.
- **#370 boundary:** Resident death fade and first Dragon breath duration are fixed. Natural reload remains comparison-inconclusive; title/load timing needs source-derived investigation. See `jev-pilot-results.md`; do not close from the symptom assertion alone.
- **Evidence boundary:** Published-route state/RNG gates cover one route. Frozen visual debt is 241 frames / 2,391 pixels. Neither that replay nor idle sweep checkpoints proves whole-game completion.

NOW is the current-state handoff: rewrite it at the end of every loop session, never
append. Old handoffs go to [`session-log.md`](./session-log.md).

For newly opened items, capture these facts in the investigation notes:

- evidence source: playtest, recording slug, oracle, or frame capture
- native repro status: reproduced / not yet reproduced
- oracle repro status: authoritative / advisory / unknown / oracle limitation
- minimum gate: `fast-slice`, `1p-playable`, `1p-accurate`, or `visual-parity`

> resolved rows and all per-issue evidence live in
> [`backlog-archive.md`](./backlog-archive.md) — grep it by `#NNN` (e.g.

| # | Status | Pri | System | Summary | Verify |
|-----|--------|-----|--------|---------|--------|
| 502 | [ ] | P1 | enemies/scheduling | Drips range checks omit the live Object-pressure branch above 20 workers. | Acquire an interleaved allocation/deletion witness crossing 20/21 Objects. |
| 300 | [~] | P1 | level/teleporter | Captured hidden and shifted pad records are restored; live destination verification remains open. | Record a successful accessible pad route and compare the destination with the oracle. |
| 433 | [~] | P1 | enemies/RNG | Robot first-init motion, shots and grounded turns verified; hurt, slot reuse and natural entry remain open. | Probe interrupted turns and acquire a natural Crypt entry. |
| 406 | [f] | P1 | rendering | FROZEN with #409 per ADR 0002: the lane stops accruing sessions; the march stays metered as ADR 0001 left it (frontier 995, injection ratchet). Residue authority moves to census-scoped reconstruction + raster-span-replay. | Do not extend the march; ratchets stay green; take #442-#450 instead. See ADR 0002. |
| 409 | [f] | P1 | rendering | FROZEN per ADR 0002: the recurrence is a downward-only witness (scheduled-frames ratchet 736 / boundary 1657; tas-pixel-baseline). ADR 0003 corrected the spans; #459 found the bounded entry phase non-invertible and closed NO-GO. | Do not extend or promote the lane; keep the 2,391-pixel and scheduled-frame ratchets green. Evidence: archive #459. |
| 416 | [f] | P2 | audio | Frontier FROZEN at frames 0..922 (decision in archive #416): `gems_frame_signature_v1` is a regression witness only; command parity (#435) supersedes it as audio authority. | Never advance `modelled_frames`; #434-#438 closed, remaining audio debt tracked via #439-#441; keep verify-tas-full green. |
