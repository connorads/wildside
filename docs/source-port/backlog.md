## Investigation notes

### 001 — Player stuck after damage (FIXED)
Root cause: `apply_damage()` did not clear `left_wall_sticky` / `right_wall_sticky`.
If the player was wall-grabbed when hit, they stayed pinned to the wall during
invulnerability frames. Fix: clear both wall-sticky fields in `apply_damage()`.

### 002 — Enemies don't die when stomped (FIXED)
Root cause: stomp detection used strict `previous_bottom <= stomp_e_top` position check,
requiring the player's feet to be precisely above the enemy's top edge on the prior frame.
The ASM uses a velocity-direction cross-product: `y_overlap × |rel_x_vel| < x_overlap × |rel_y_vel|`
to determine approach direction. Reimplemented to match ASM — stomps are now detected based
on vertical approach direction, not prior-frame position history.

### 003 — Audio (FIXED)
GEMS engine is fully wired: BGM per theme, SFX for jump/stomp/damage/death/form/block.
Audio init now reports specific SDL2 errors with troubleshooting hints (SDL_AUDIODRIVER,
audio support). Triggers BGM on first InGame entry. Pipeline verified correct.

### 004 — Palette (FIXED)
Root cause: theme-specific palette permutation tables were not applied. The ASM art
decompression remaps palette indices per theme (Forest, City, Mountain have unique tables).
Fix: load 16-byte permutation tables and reorder palette entries during level visual loading.

### 005 — Parallax (NOT A BUG)
Parallax IS working. bgscroll data loads correctly, `background_scroll_x_px()` applies
camera-relative rates. Effect is subtle (e.g. Forest: 26% camera speed) matching original.

### 006 — Dragon moonwalking (FIXED)
Root cause: `select_enemy_frame` used global `trace.frame_index` for ALL enemies,
cycling walk frames even when the dragon is in a stationary phase (perch/parked).
Fix: added `stationary` field to NativeObjectSnapshot, populated from
`DragonMotionPhase::is_stationary()`. Stationary enemies show frame 0 (idle).

### 010 — Enemy attacks (MOSTLY DONE)
11 enemy families + 4 bosses + 3 helmets + 3 environmental sources have projectile support.
Only gaps: UFO beam (child object system, spawns beam segments) and Fire Demon fire trails
(child objects spawned on death). Both require a child-object spawning system not yet built.
All simple projectile-based attacks are implemented.

### 011 — Bricks half-broken (FIXED)
Resolved by palette permutation fix (#004). Verified via capture-frames comparison —
block tiles render with correct colours matching original game.

### 013 — P-blocks (NOT A BUG)
Prize blocks vanish when hit (cell cleared to empty). This is correct per original behaviour.

### 015 — Wall grab (FIXED)
Added `left_wall_sticky` field and mirrored right-wall logic in `apply_wall_collision()`.
Both directions now support airborne wall-sticky with overhang top-edge retention.

### 017/019 — Helmets and form transform (FIXED)
`apply_prize_content` → `queue_form_change` → `resolve_pending_form_change` chain is wired
and verified. Forms change player hitbox, speed table, and abilities. FloatingItem spawns
on prize hit with content-type-specific colours. Unit tests confirm IronKnight and
Juggernaut transforms trigger correctly with proper hitpoint assignment.

### 018 — Form-change animation (PLACEHOLDER)
White flash overlay on player sprite for 8 frames after form transform.
Real spinning sprite animation needs reverse-engineering from ASM.

### 020 — Water shimmer (DONE)
Rows at or past `effect_start_row_selector` get horizontal sine offset
(2px amplitude, ~16-row period). Period and amplitude need ASM verification.

### 021 — Sound Test (FIXED)
Options menu cursor==1 now enters Sound Test screen. Left/Right ±1, Up/Down ±16,
A/C plays track via GEMS engine, B returns to options.

### 022 — Duplicate Game Over overlay (FIXED)
Scene rendering had two `if trace.game_over` blocks (lines 1023 and 1091).
Removed the duplicate.
